(Project can be found at: http://www.inertia7.com/projects/time-series-stock-market-python)

## Abstract
This project focuses on deriving the best statistical-learning model to predict future values for the **S&P 500 Stock Index** with **Python**.

Understanding the **S&P 500 Stock Index** is highly-relevant in understanding the health of the U.S. economy as it is highly-correlated (statistically) with other U.S. economic indicators such as other stock indices (e.g. the NASDAQ Stock Index and the NYSE Stock Exchange), the U.S. Housing Price Index, and the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (U.S. GDP).

Time-series analysis is a basic concept within the field of statistical-learning, which is appropriate for the analysis of the **S&P 500 Stock Index**.

For this project we leverage the horse-power of Python and deliver, where appropriate, gorgeous data visualizations using **matplotlib**.
